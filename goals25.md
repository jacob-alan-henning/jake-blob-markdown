# Did I achieve my goals for 2025 

## the state of everything
This year was a roller coaster; a year of uncertainty. Professionally the biggest change was Walmart's divestment of their robotics division to symbotic. Fortunately I was not caught up in the layoffs; something I attribute to sheer luck. It's strange to be only one of two people left from a 15 person team you were close with. Fortunately most of the fellow sre's found gainful employment; something very much not the common story. 

I got moved from sre infrastructure to cloud infrastructure and now baremetal k8's. I got to work on some interesting projects throughout this year ranging from finops initiatives, migrating a saas solution to a self hosted solution in the cloud, to automating ceph cluster resiliency testing. There was definitely a bit of whiplash but all in all it was good for me. I do enjoy working on different problems even if at times it feels like you have to be learning at a breakneck speed to keep pace with specialists. 

All that being said; what did I write down and what did I do?

## Goals 
This is what I set for myself in 2025
```
Azure cert path 
Admin and maybe arch
cks 

Take performance seriously 
Be able to read assembly and reason about it

Better knowledge 
General programming 
Complete blog roadmap and blog it
Code crafter projects
Maybe something unique that builds off one and blog about it
I should be really comfortable writing golang
Rewrite blog in rust and profile do I actually learn rust this year?
```

I should preface that I don't really believe that certs mean very much. However I did list them as things as I should do and I do have an active cka and have had aws certs.

Azure cert path - after a few years in azure work pivoted to gcp and I did not pursue azure certs. Thats a fail 
CKS - I did not take the cks. Fail 

I did make much better progress on my goal of taking performance a lot more seriously. At some point in this process; I have realized that some of my fundamentals from school where actually pretty fuzzy and not very useful or accurate. I had to go back to fundamentals a bit. I reread operating systems in 3 easy pieces, did the code exercises and I also paid for a course on performant programming which I am about halfway through. A lot of the information wasn't new but it also wasn't clear. I did make a half baked arm64 tui stepper which did help.

I believe I am much stronger in reasoning about performance. Nothing earth shattering happened but I am much more comfortable making guesses and being able to squeeze better perf out of. I am still not very comfortable with a lot of algos. But I can look them up most of the time and the type of code I write at work is more o(1) so a lot of gains I see are from mechanical waste. I've strengthened my programming fundamentals to complement my infrastructure work and I am enjoying the process of being able to program with a higher degree of proficiency. I can see a point where there will be few infra people in the future without these kind of skills ready to go. Its simply too useful a skill to ignore or pretend admins have any kind of future outside the most stagnant of enterprises. 

Something throughout this process I became paranoid about was using an llm too heavily; however I have developed some guidelines that I think negate my concerns. 

* do not trust the llm 
* use it to ask questions and verify with outside sources
* use books and other sources besides llms 
* when doing an exercise don't use llms; its better to have to work through the problem and keep the typing mechanics sharp. You can treat it like a tutor but the tutor needs to know it cant give you a solution but can point you to a chapter or resolve obvious syntax issues in python
* use an llm to setup throughaway code to help understand a concept. 

I did actually keep blogging through the entire year. Which was a win. 

I did become much more comfortable writing go but I did not bother with rust this year and Im less sure that I will pursue it in the immediate future. 

I attribute some of the deviation from a changing work environment. I did become much stronger in k8's at a lower level than I was expecting and I did learn a fair amount of gcp. 

I'm not dissatisfied with what I accomplished this year. I become a much stronger technologist through roundabout ways and kept learning things which were useful for work. However it is funny to look back and realize I thought I would have all this time to grind azure. Honestly what happened was likely better.

## Goals 2026 
It's time to look forward for what I want to accomplish in 2026. However I want to attach some caveats to these goals. 

* I am limiting these goals to specific technical skills. I am not looking at initiatives or goals in the context of a specific goals. I have desires outside of being an IC forever but most higher level jobs I see treat managers as IC's. I'm not sure I can rise without being a super brent first.
* I am incredibly lucky and have had the chance to work with incredible people who have altered my trajectory.
* I am more comfortable with my traditional admin skills than my programming skills 
* I am including personal and angling goals 

without further adieu 

* Develop a piece of software I could use daily
* Become much stronger on baremetal automation 
* Write fewer more high quality blog posts
* Become more comfortable tying flys across more patterns 
* Spend more weekends on small streams targeting wild trout 
* Move out of my parents house
