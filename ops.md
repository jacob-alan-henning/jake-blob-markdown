# Operating software is hard 
It is very very difficult to run software over a long period especially if other people use it. 

I think there is general confusion on what it means to operate software. 

In my head and the most reductive way I can phrase 

it means to be responsible for software running long and correctly enough to solve someones problem. 

It does not neccesarily mean that you created the software but there is certainly overlap. Software that has to interact with people and systems is the worst. 

Between a 

* a deployment that scales
* redundancy
* a secure environment
* a repeatable deployment
* flexible environment
* right sized environment
* cicd pipelines which provide clear, quick, repeatable feedback 
* security
* reliable monitoring with actionable alerts and runbooks

There is a lot of ways for things to go wrong. Also a lot of things can go right 

But to get things right operating software is not a checklist. 

It is a constant battle agasint nature. You will never get it right the first try. You have to keep refining. Always iterating and tweaking. 

Eventually you reach a point where it is easy, automation is rock solid, you know days before incidents happen, and you don't recieve too many angry tickets. This is where it gets really hard. 

Getting to a good place is not staying in a good place. Wack back the weeds. Sleep in too many times and your lawn is overgrown. 

The point I want to make is that operating software is endless. There is not a done, there is always a better. 

But its all possible - a constant cycle of death and rebirth. 

How little can you get away with? I don't know the question is why would you want to get away with it. Isn't this fun
